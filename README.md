# ZipExample
WebAPI of Users and Accounts

Thankyou for reviewing!

I used Win10 as a dev environment and tried docker with windows containers (linux was not supported)

I tried adding Postgres and MySQL db but they were not supported on windows.

I tried adding MSSQL Development but it is so huge that it is not really appropriate.

Please run this as a console app then. It will run a web server.

The api urls are 

/api/Users
/api/Accounts/{userId}

I will stop now as the docker issues took a some time to figure out.

Cheers!

Joe Warwick
